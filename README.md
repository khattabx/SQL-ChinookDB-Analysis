## Overview

Analyze the Chinook Database using SQL to extract business insights—such as top-selling products, revenue by region, and monthly performance—through JOINs, aggregations, and window functions.

## Why SQL Analysis ?

The data is only in a database format, so I have to use SQL queries to answer the business questions.

### Business Questions

- Top-Selling Products.
- Revenue Per Region.
- Monthly Performance.

### Steps to Follow

- You will find all the SQL Queries in the [sql_script.sql](SQL/) file, and the most important file to fully understand the whole process is the [sql_process.md](SQL/).

**Main Files to Check:**

- `SQL/Chinook_MySql.sql` → Database scripts.
- `LICENSE.md` → Outher License
